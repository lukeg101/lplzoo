# Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with Subtyping
Haskell implementation on Benjamin Pierce's Lambda Calculus with Subtyping. It has the features of STLC but with generalised records, a Unit type, and subtype polymorphism.

This strongly normalising calculus serves as a foundation for object-oriented  languages such as Java, Scala, and Python.

## Prerequisites
You need [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), this compiles with GHC 8.2.2 at least (Stack resolver: lts-11.0).

## To Build & Run

To compile and run do:
`ghc -O2 -o sub Main`
then run `./sub`

Alternatively to use the GHCi Interpreter do:
`ghci Main`
then type `main`

In either case you get something like the following:
```
Welcome to the Sub REPL
Type some terms or press Enter to leave.
>
```

Note: When run in GHCi, you don't have the luxury of escaped characters, backspace, delete etc...
Compile it using GHC if you need this.

## Examples 
Where you can then have some fun, try these examples:
- TODO
- `\1:{2:A, 3:B}.1` this is the identity function for records
- TODO 

The parser is smart enough to recognise 位; so you can copy and paste from the output:
```
Welcome to the Sub REPL
Type some terms or press Enter to leave.
> \1:{2:A, 3:B}.1
位1:{2:A, 3:B}.1
> 位1:{2:A, 3:B}.1
位1:{2:A, 3:B}.1
```

There is also a reduction tracer, which should print each reduction step. prefix any string with `'` in order to see the reductions:
```
TODO
```
There is also a typing mechanism, which should display the type or fail as usual.
```
> t\1:{2:A, 3:B}.1.3
{2:A, 3:B}->B
> t\1:{2:A, 3:B}.1.5
Cannot Type Term: \1:{2:A, 3:B}.1.5
```

Note: if you provide a non-normalizing term, the type checker will fail and reduction will not occur.

## Syntax 

We base the language on the BNF for the typed calculus, with the addition of generalised records, record projections (using the record names as projections), the unit, and types for these terms:

However we adopt standard bracketing conventions to eliminate ambiguity in the parser. Concretely, the parser implements the non-ambiguous grammar for terms as follows:

TODO 

and types:

TODO

with variables:

TODO

Some notes about the syntax:

- Variables are positive integers (including zero) as this is easy for Haskell to process, and for me implement variable generation. This is isomorphic to a whiteboard treatment using characters (like `\x:1.x`).
- Types range over upper-case characters `A,B,C...`, nested arrow types: `T -> T`, the unit type `()`, and generalised record types `{1:A,2:B->A,...,8:C}`.
- Arrows associate to the right so that `T -> T -> T` is the same as `T -> (T -> T)` but not `((T -> T) -> T)`. 
- Nested terms don't need brackets: `\1:A.\2:B. 2` unless enforcing application on the right. Whitespace does not matter `\1:{2:A, 3:B}.    1` unless it is between application where you need at least one space.
- TODO subtyping
- To quit use `Ctrl+C` or whatever your machine uses to interrupt computations.

## Semantics

The semantics implements beta-reduction on terms and alpha-equivalence as the `Eq` instance of `STerm`. The semantics are the same as STLC with the addition of subtype polymorphism with augments the typing relation with a subtyping relation `<`. We reformulate the semantics as [typing judgements](https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/):

We have typing rules for the Unit type (otherwise known as Top):

TODO

The subtyping relation is a reflexive and transitive relation `<` defined as follows:

These rules denote reflexivity, transitivity, that `()` is the _supertype_ of all types, and the arrow-subtyping rule for functions. The standard typing rules from STLC are then influenced by this:

TODO

for abstractions:

TODO

for application:

TODO

and the reduction relation (adopted from STLC):

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\lambda&space;x&space;:&space;T&space;.&space;M)N&space;\rightsquigarrow&space;M&space;[x&space;:=&space;N]" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\lambda&space;x&space;:&space;T&space;.&space;M)N&space;\rightsquigarrow&space;M&space;[x&space;:=&space;N]" title="(\lambda x : T . M)N \rightsquigarrow M [x := N]" /></a>

and special introduction, elimination, and reduction rules for records:

TODO

- This implementation follows a [small-step](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/43294/difference-between-small-and-big-step-operational-semantics) operational semantics and Berendregt's [variable convention](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/69323/barendregts-variable-convention-what-does-it-mean) (see `substitution` in Sub.hs). The variable convention is adopted for both types and terms.
- Reductions include the one-step reduction (see `reduce1` in Sub.hs), the many-step reduction (see `reduce` in Sub.hs). 

## Other Implementation Details
- Sub.hs contains the Haskell implementation of the calculus, including substitution, subtyping, reduction, and other useful things.
- Parser.hs contains the monadic parser combinators needed to parse input strings into typed-term ASTs for the calculus.
- Repl.hs contains a simple read-eval-print loop which hooks into main, and into the parser.
- Main.hs is needed for GHC to compile without any flags, it also invokes the repl.
